* [The Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/challenging-inequality/internet-freedom/)

This repository contains the details of our contractual obligations to our fiscal sponsor Brave New Software and any commitments we have made in exchange for financial support. This respository also contains any successful application for financial support in full. 

## Aim

Our aim here are simple. Complete transparency and accountabilty of our actions on behalf of our community, by the community. 

## On Financial Support

We acknowledge that is it very difficult to accept financial support for a project without influencing its direction. We have taken great care to ensure that our supporters share our values, are aligned with our strategy and happy to support our work. That said we must accept that in order to work full-time on Libraires.io there must be a degree of compromise with regard to establishing and meeting shared goals in exchange for financial support. 

## Commitments

Any commitment we have made to a supporter will be ticketed in this repository. Any tickets upon which a commitment depends will be referenced bilaterally from this repository. 

## Contributing

Please feel free to comment upon, take issue at or otherwise hold the project, our obligations and our interpretation of those obligations to account using comments.
